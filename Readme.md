# Earnings for Managing Community Events

## Project Description

The *Earnings for Managing Community Events* smart contract enables community event managers to create, manage, and complete events, while earning rewards upon successful event completion. Event managers are compensated with Ether (or tokens) for their efforts in organizing the events, creating a decentralized, transparent, and secure environment. Participants can join events, and the contract tracks the completion status to ensure that managers are rewarded fairly.

This project leverages blockchain technology to incentivize event managers, promote community engagement, and ensure transparent and tamper-proof reward distribution.

## Project Vision

The vision behind the *Community Event Earnings* project is to foster community engagement by enabling individuals to organize and manage local or virtual events while being rewarded fairly for their work. By leveraging blockchain technology, the project promotes decentralization, transparency, and a secure reward system that ensures event managers are compensated for their contributions.

### Key aspects of the project vision:
- **Decentralization**: The platform allows anyone to create and manage events with minimal intermediaries involved.
- **Transparency**: Every action, from event creation to the reward distribution, is recorded and verifiable on the blockchain.
- **Incentivization**: Event organizers are financially rewarded for completing their events, encouraging more people to organize and lead events.
- **Community Engagement**: Promotes the idea of community-driven events that strengthen social bonds and increase participation in local and virtual gatherings.

## Key Features

### 1. **Event Creation**
   - Event managers can create new events by specifying an event name. Each event is automatically assigned a unique ID.
   - The contract tracks each event, its manager, and the number of participants.

### 2. **Event Participation**
   - Participants can join an event by specifying the event ID. The contract tracks the number of participants for each event.
   - Events remain open for participation until they are completed by the event manager.

### 3. **Event Completion and Rewards**
   - Once the event is completed, the event manager can call a function to mark it as finished.
   - Upon event completion, the manager is rewarded with a predefined amount of Ether for their efforts in organizing the event.

### 4. **Funds Deposit**
   - The contract owner can deposit Ether into the contract, which will be used to fund the rewards for event managers.
   - This ensures the system has liquidity to reward event managers when they complete events.

### 5. **Withdraw Earnings**
   - After completing an event, the event manager can withdraw their earned rewards from the contract.
   - The function ensures that event managers can easily access their funds after event completion.

### 6. **Transparency**
   - All events, participants, and rewards are publicly available on the Ethereum blockchain.
   - Anyone can verify the details and status of an event, ensuring transparency and fairness.

### 7. **Security and Decentralization**
   - The smart contract logic ensures that only authorized parties (event managers and the contract owner) can execute specific functions.
   - The contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, benefiting from its secure, tamper-proof environment.
